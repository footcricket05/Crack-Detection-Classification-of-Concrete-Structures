# Crack Detection & Classification of Concrete Structures


## Overview
The "Crack Detection & Classification of Concrete Structures" project aims to develop a system that can detect and classify cracks in concrete structures using image processing and machine learning techniques. This system involves pre-processing of images, feature extraction using edge detection and segmentation techniques, and classification using a convolutional neural network (CNN).


## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the system includes images of concrete structures with and without cracks. The dataset is available on Kaggle at this link - https://www.kaggle.com/code/dhruv1234/crack-detection-opencv/input.


## Results
The accuracy of the system is evaluated using performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. The results indicate that the proposed system is effective in detecting and classifying cracks in concrete structures with high accuracy.


## Repository Contents
The repository includes the following files:

1. `Crack-Detection-Classification-of-Concrete-Structures-DL.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the crack detection and classification system

2. `Crack-Detection-Classification-of-Concrete-Structures-DL.ipynb`: Python script version of the Jupyter notebook for easier integration into a production environment.

3. `README.md`: Readme file with an overview of the project and instructions for running the code


## Usage
To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Download the dataset from the Kaggle link provided above.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine.

3. Open the `Crack-Detection-Classification-of-Concrete-Structures-DL.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible environment.

4. Run the code cells in the notebook to train and test the crack detection and classification system.
